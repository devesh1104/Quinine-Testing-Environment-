```
✅ Already configured in `config_local.yaml`

## 🔧 Configuration Details

**Model Setup:**
```yaml
type: local_gguf                    # Model type
model_name: C:\path\to\mistral...  # GGUF file path (already set)
```

**Inference Settings:**
```yaml
temperature: 0.7      # Creative responses
max_tokens: 512       # Max response length
top_p: 0.95          # Diversity
timeout: 120         # seconds
```

**Execution Settings:**
```yaml
max_concurrent_attacks: 1    # Sequential (required for local)
pool_size: 1                 # Single thread
delay_between_attacks_ms: 500
```

## 📊 What Tests Run

The framework tests for:
- ✅ **Prompt Injection** - Can hidden commands override system instructions?
- ✅ **Jailbreaks** - Can safety guidelines be bypassed?
- ✅ **PII Leakage** - Does it reveal personal/sensitive data?
- ✅ **Hallucinations** - Does it make up false information?

**Complexity levels:**
- LOW - Basic, obvious attacks
- MEDIUM - Subtle, indirect attacks
- HIGH - Advanced, complex attacks

## 💾 Output Files

After running `python quickstart_local.py`, you'll have:

```
reports/
├── report_UUID.html     ← Open in browser (visual report)
└── report_UUID.json     ← Raw data (machine-readable)

logs/
└── results.jsonl        ← Execution log (one JSON per line)
```

**Report contains:**
- Attack categories tested
- Compliance scores (refused %, partial %, full %)
- Specific vulnerabilities found
- Model responses to each attack
- Execution metrics (latency, tokens, duration)

## ⚡ Performance Tips

### GPU Acceleration (Recommended)

**Before (CPU):** ~10-15 sec per attack  
**After (GPU):** ~2-3 sec per attack  

**Set up GPU support:**

*NVIDIA CUDA:*
```powershell
pip install llama-cpp-python --extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cu121
```

*Apple Silicon Metal:*
```bash
CMAKE_ARGS='-DLLAMA_METAL=on' pip install llama-cpp-python
```

### Quick Tests (Skip High Complexity)

Edit `config_local.yaml`:
```yaml
complexity_levels:
  - "LOW"
  # - "MEDIUM"  # Comment out
  # - "HIGH"    # Comment out
```

## 🐛 Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: llama_cpp` | `pip install llama-cpp-python` |
| `FileNotFoundError` on model | Check path in `config_local.yaml` |
| "Out of memory" | Use GPU or close other apps |
| Very slow tests | Install GPU support |
| Port already in use | Not applicable (no server) |

## 🔄 Typical Workflow

```
1. python quickstart_local.py
   │
2. ⏳ Loading model... (10-30 seconds)
   │
3. 🔍 Running attacks... (5-10 minutes depending on count)
   │
4. ✅ Tests complete
   │
5. 📊 Open reports/report_*.html in browser
   │
6. 📈 Analyze vulnerabilities
   │
7. (Optional) Customize config & rerun
```
