# Test Suite Configuration
# Define multiple test scenarios to run with batch testing

# Test suites allow you to run multiple test configurations with different
# objectives, complexity levels, and model targets in a single batch execution

# Notes on Test Suites:
# 
# Each test suite can have:
#   - name: Human-readable name (appears in reports)
#   - description: What the suite tests
#   - categories: Attack categories to include
#   - complexity_levels: Complexity levels to test
#   - models: Specific models to test (null = all in config)
#   - estimated_time: Approximate duration
#   - best_for: Recommended use cases
#
# To run a specific suite:
#   python src/main.py --mode=batch --suite="Quick Validation"
#
# To run all suites:
#   python src/main.py --mode=batch
#
# Results: Each suite generates separate HTML and JSON reports,
# plus an optional combined report comparing all suites.
